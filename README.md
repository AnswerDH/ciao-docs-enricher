ciao-docs-enricher
==================

*CIP to enrich parsed documents with additional properties*

Introduction
------------

The purpose of this CIP is to process an incoming [parsed document][1] by
enriching it with additional properties before publishing the enriched document
for further processing by other CIPs.

`ciao-docs-enricher` is built on top of [Apache Camel][2] and [Spring
Framework][3], and can be run as a stand-alone Java application, or via
[Docker][4].

[3]: <http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/>

Each application can host multiple [routes][5], where each route follows the
following basic structure:

[5]: <http://camel.apache.org/routes.html>

>   input JMS queue -\> `DocumentEnricher` or `AsyncDocumentEnricher` -\> output
>   JMS queue

The details of the JMS queues and document enrichers are specified at runtime
through a combination of [ciao-configuration][6] properties and Spring XML
files.

The following document enricher implementations are provided:

-   `JsonResourceDocumentEnricher` - An enricher which reads JSON content from
    the filesystem or classpath and merges it into the document properties. This
    can be used to include static content which is not available in the original
    source document.

-   `PDSDocumentEnricher` - An enricher which performs a PDS lookup based on
    properties previously extracted from the source document (e.g. NHS number),
    and merges the retrieved detail into the document properties.

For more advanced usages, a custom document enricher can be integrated by
implementing one of the enricher Java interfaces and providing a suitable spring
XML configuration on the classpath.
